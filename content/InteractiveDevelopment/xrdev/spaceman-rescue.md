# Spaceman Rescue

## Overview
Spaceman Rescue is a short story-based VR game where you play as an astronaut witnessing your friend being hit by an asteroid. Your mission is to navigate through space and rescue him using only two extinguishers in a zero-gravity environment.

Ever wondered what it feels like to float freely in space? This game offers you the chance to experience navigating through space with just two extinguishers to propel you. It's a challenging task, and in real life, any mistake could be fatal. However, in VR, you can practice as many times as you like without the risks.

## Play Mechanics
The movement in the game is based on the direction and amount of force applied through the extinguishers. When you load the game project in your VR headset, you will find yourself in a space station. To control and maneuver, use the triggers on both hands to activate the extinguishers. The direction in which the extinguishers aim will push you in the opposite direction, allowing for rotation and movement in space.

## Onboarding Instructions
1. Load the game project in your VR headset.
2. You will be placed in a space station.
3. Use the triggers on both hands to press the extinguishers separately.
4. Aim the extinguishers to navigate through space, keeping in mind that you will rotate based on the force applied.

## The Making of the Game
Creating realistic movement mechanics was a challenge that I thoroughly enjoyed. I programmed simulations to accurately reflect how forces act on objects in space. The complexity lies in managing both the push and rotation of the player character, which involves calculations of rotational force and angular speed.
