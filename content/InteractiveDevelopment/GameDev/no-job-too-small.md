# No Job Too Small

A game jam submission that ranked 56 among 7600 entries in the GMTK Game Jam 2024, where players control a giant intern in a tiny office environment.

## Project Overview

"No Job Too Small" is a humorous game where you play as a comically oversized intern in a tiny office. The game was created for the GMTK Game Jam 2024 with the theme "Build to Scale." The exaggerated scale of the character directly influences gameplay, making simple office tasks like fetching coffee or organizing files into complex challenges.

## My Role: Game Development Lead

- Engineered core interaction mechanics, including object manipulation systems
- Integrated and optimized artistic and design assets into the game environment
- Performed comprehensive testing and optimization to ensure seamless web performance

## Game Mechanics

The game features a destruction meter that adds an extra layer of strategy, tracking how much chaos you cause due to your size and grading your performance from "Gentle Giant" to "Bull in a China Shop." This literal interpretation of "Build to Scale" not only challenges players to think about how scale impacts interaction but also adds a humorous twist, as the title "No Job Too Small" ironically suggests that even the smallest tasks can become monumental.
