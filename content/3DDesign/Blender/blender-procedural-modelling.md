# Procedural Modelling

## Overview
Procedural modelling using graph nodes in Blender.

## Process
1. **Node Setup**: Created the procedural node network
2. **Parameter Tuning**: Adjusted parameters to achieve desired shapes
3. **Material Integration**: Connected material parameters to the procedural system
4. **Optimization**: Optimized the node network for better performance
5. **Rendering**: Set up lighting and rendered various iterations

## Technical Details
This project explores the power of Blender's geometry nodes to create complex shapes without manual modeling. By connecting various nodes like noise, displacement, and boolean operations, I was able to generate organic forms that would be difficult to model traditionally.

## Tools Used
- Blender 3.0
- Geometry Nodes
- Cycles renderer
