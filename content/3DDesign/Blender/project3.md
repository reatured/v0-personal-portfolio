# Teddy Bear

## Overview
Hair modelling with particle system based on real teddy bear toy.

## Process
1. **Base Modeling**: Created the base teddy bear model
2. **UV Mapping**: Prepared UVs for texturing
3. **Particle System Setup**: Set up the hair particle system
4. **Hair Styling**: Styled the fur to match the reference
5. **Material Creation**: Created realistic fur material
6. **Rendering**: Set up lighting and rendered the final image

## Challenges
Getting the fur to look realistic was challenging. I had to carefully adjust the particle count, length, and styling to achieve a believable teddy bear look. The render times were also quite long due to the complexity of the hair system.

## Tools Used
- Blender 2.8
- Particle hair system
- Cycles renderer
