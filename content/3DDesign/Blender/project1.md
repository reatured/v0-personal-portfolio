# Modelling with Google Map Data

Large scale wall poster designed by combining two different Google Map datasets and implementing 3D model data in Blender.

## Project Details

For this project, I implemented 3D model data in two different styles into Blender. By adding various lighting techniques and effects, I was able to create astonishing visual representations of different cities.

The process involved:
- Extracting and combining data from two different Google Map datasets
- Importing the data into Blender and creating 3D models
- Applying two distinct visual styles to showcase the cities' unique characteristics
- Experimenting with lighting, shadows, and atmospheric effects to enhance depth and realism
- Rendering high-quality images suitable for large-scale wall posters

The result is a series of striking cityscapes that blend cartographic accuracy with artistic interpretation, creating visually captivating representations of urban environments.

### Featured Cities

The project showcases four distinct cities, each with its unique urban layout and architectural character:

- **Cologne:** Highlighting the city's blend of historic architecture and modern development along the Rhine River.
- **Macau:** Capturing the dense urban landscape and the iconic casinos that define this former Portuguese colony.
- **New York:** Emphasizing the grid-like street pattern and the towering skyscrapers of Manhattan.
- **San Francisco:** Illustrating the city's famous hills, bay, and diverse neighborhood layouts.

Each cityscape is rendered with attention to detail, showcasing the unique topography, street patterns, and architectural features that make these urban environments distinct and recognizable.
