# Modelling with Google Map Data

Large scale A1 size wall posters designed by combining two different Google Map datasets that provide 2 different styles of building models.
1. simplified block meshes of buildings without texture for peripheral buildings
2. Detailed textured models for landmarks buildings


# Different Time Zones
Different time zones is represented by different lighting throughout the day. 
1. Maucau around 10 at at noon time with the direct sun light,
2. Cologne at 4 am with the sunrise lighting
3. New York at 10 pm at late night with all the neon lighting,
4. San Francisco at 7 pm in the shown with orange sunset light

For this project, I implemented 3D model data in two different styles into Blender. By adding various lighting techniques and effects, I was able to create astonishing visual representations of different cities.

The process involved:
- Extracting and combining data from two different Google Map datasets
- Importing the data into Blender and creating 3D models
- Applying two distinct visual styles to focus on city's unique Landmarks
- Experimenting with lighting, shadows, and atmospheric effects to enhance depth and realism
- Rendering high-quality images suitable for large-scale wall posters

The result is a series of striking cityscapes that blend cartographic accuracy with artistic interpretation, creating visually captivating representations of urban environments.


# Featured Cities and Their Landmark Buildings

The project showcases four distinct cities, each with its unique urban layout and architectural character:

- **Cologne:** Highlighting the Cologne Cathedral, a stunning example of Gothic architecture and a UNESCO World Heritage site.
- **Macau:** Capturing the iconic Venetian Macao, a luxurious resort and casino that replicates the charm of Venice.
- **New York:** Emphasizing the Empire State Building, an iconic symbol of New York City, known for its Art Deco design and breathtaking views from its observation deck, representing the city's skyline.
- **San Francisco:** Illustrating the Transamerica Pyramid, a distinctive skyscraper that is a hallmark of the San Francisco skyline, known for its unique triangular shape and serving as a symbol of the city's financial district.

Each cityscape is rendered with attention to detail, showcasing the unique topography, street patterns, and architectural features that make these urban environments distinct and recognizable.




# Printed Posters

The posters were printed on an HP DesignJet plotter, ensuring vibrant color quality on A1 paper.
