# Modelling with Google Map Data

## Overview
Large scale wall poster designed by combining two different Google Map datasets and implementing 3D model data in Blender.

## Process
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered geographical data from Google Maps API
2. **Data Processing**: Converted the raw data into a format usable in Blender
3. **3D Modeling**: Created the 3D representation of the map in Blender
4. **Texturing**: Applied realistic textures to the model
5. **Rendering**: Rendered the final image for printing

## Challenges
One of the main challenges was aligning the different datasets accurately. I solved this by creating a custom script to normalize the coordinate systems between the datasets.

## Tools Used
- Blender 2.93
- Google Maps API
- Python for data processing
- Adobe Photoshop for post-processing

## Result
The final poster measures 36" x 24" and shows a detailed 3D representation of the city with accurate building heights and terrain features.
