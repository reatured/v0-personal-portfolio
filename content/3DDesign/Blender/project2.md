# Cartoon Shader

# Cartoon Shader

## Overview
Modelling and Coloring with Toon Shader in Blender.

## Process
1. **Base Modeling**: Created the base 3D models
2. **Shader Development**: Developed custom toon shader in Blender
3. **Material Application**: Applied the shader to different objects
4. **Lighting Setup**: Created lighting that works well with toon shading
5. **Animation**: Added simple animation to showcase the shader

## Technical Details
The toon shader was created using Blender's shader nodes, combining color ramps with fresnel effects to achieve the cartoon look. The shader includes customizable parameters for line thickness, color saturation, and shadow softness.

## Tools Used
- Blender 3.0
- Custom shader nodes
- Animation tools
