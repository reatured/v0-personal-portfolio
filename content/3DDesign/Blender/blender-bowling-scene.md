# Bowling Scene
## Overview
Modelled and rendered a bowling scene in Blender.

## Process
1. **Scene Planning**: Sketched the layout and planned the composition
2. **Modeling**: Created all scene elements (bowling pins, ball, lane)
3. **Texturing**: Applied realistic materials and textures
4. **Lighting**: Set up studio lighting to highlight the scene
5. **Rendering**: Rendered the final image with Cycles

## Technical Details
This scene focuses on realistic materials and lighting to create a convincing bowling alley atmosphere. Special attention was paid to the reflections on the polished lane and the subtle subsurface scattering on the bowling pins.

## Tools Used Check Check
- Blender 2.9
- Cycles renderer
- PBR materials
