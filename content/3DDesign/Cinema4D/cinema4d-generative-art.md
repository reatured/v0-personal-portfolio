# Generative Art

## Overview
Procedural generative art created with Cinema 4D.

## Process
1. **System Design**: Designed the generative system rules
2. **Mograph Setup**: Set up MoGraph effectors and cloners
3. **Animation**: Created procedural animation
4. **Material Creation**: Applied dynamic materials
5. **Rendering**: Rendered the animation sequence

## Technical Details
This generative art piece uses Cinema 4D's MoGraph system to create complex patterns from simple rules. The animation is driven by mathematical formulas that create emergent behavior from the interaction of multiple effectors.

## Tools Used
- Cinema 4D
- MoGraph system
- Redshift Renderer
