# Donut

# Donut

## Overview
Procedural modelling, rendered with motion blur.

## Process
1. **Base Shape Creation**: Created the base donut shape
2. **Procedural Detailing**: Added procedural details like sprinkles
3. **Material Setup**: Created realistic donut materials
4. **Animation**: Set up rotation animation
5. **Rendering**: Rendered with motion blur for dynamic effect

## Technical Details
This donut was created entirely using procedural techniques in Houdini. The sprinkles are distributed using point instancing with controlled randomness, and the icing uses noise displacement for organic variation.

## Tools Used
- Houdini 18
- Procedural modeling tools
- Mantra Renderer
