# Fluid Simulation

## Overview
Fluid simulation animation created in Houdini.

## Process
1. **Simulation Setup**: Set up the fluid simulation parameters
2. **Container Modeling**: Created the container geometry
3. **FLIP Solver Configuration**: Configured the FLIP solver for realistic fluid behavior
4. **Material Creation**: Created realistic water material
5. **Rendering**: Rendered the simulation with Mantra

## Technical Details
This project explores Houdini's powerful FLIP fluid solver to create realistic water simulation. The simulation includes surface tension, viscosity, and splashing effects to achieve a convincing liquid behavior.

## Tools Used
- Houdini 19
- FLIP Solver
- Mantra Renderer
