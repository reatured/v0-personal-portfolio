# Canon Animation

# Canon Animation

## Overview
Idling animation of a canon.

## Process
1. **Modeling**: Created the canon model with detailed parts
2. **Rigging**: Set up a simple rig for the moving parts
3. **Animation**: Created the idling animation sequence
4. **Texturing**: Applied materials and textures
5. **Rendering**: Rendered the animation sequence

## Technical Details
This animation focuses on subtle movements to create a "breathing" effect for the canon, making it feel alive even when idle. The rig includes controls for the wheels, barrel, and firing mechanism.

## Tools Used
- Autodesk Maya
- Maya's animation tools
- Arnold Renderer
