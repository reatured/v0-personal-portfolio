# Product Model

## Overview
Shelf Bracket Modelling to Product Production.

## Process
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Analyzed structural requirements
2. **Concept Sketching**: Created initial design concepts
3. **CAD Modeling**: Developed precise 3D model in Fusion 360
4. **Stress Testing**: Performed digital stress tests
5. **Production Preparation**: Prepared files for manufacturing

## Technical Details
This shelf bracket was designed with both aesthetics and structural integrity in mind. The parametric modeling approach in Fusion 360 allowed for quick iterations and testing of different load capacities before finalizing the design.

## Tools Used
- Fusion 360
- Stress analysis tools
- CAM for production preparation
