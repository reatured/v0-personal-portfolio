# DOLLARS Chat Application - Design Documentation

## Overview

The DOLLARS Chat Application is a modern, real-time messaging platform inspired by the fictional chat room from the anime "Durarara!!". This application provides users with a seamless chat experience, featuring instant message delivery, user authentication, and a sleek, responsive interface.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Next.js for server-side rendering and optimal performance
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive and customizable UI components
- **Backend**: Supabase for authentication, database, and real-time subscriptions
- **Deployment**: Vercel for continuous deployment and serverless functions

## Key Features

### User Authentication

- Email/password registration and login
- OAuth integration with Google and GitHub
- Secure session management
- Password recovery functionality

### Real-time Messaging

- Instant message delivery using Supabase's real-time subscriptions
- Message status indicators (sent, delivered, read)
- Typing indicators
- Message history with infinite scrolling

### User Experience

- Responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Dark mode and light mode themes
- Customizable user profiles with avatars
- Notification system for new messages

### Security Features

- End-to-end encryption for private messages
- XSS protection
- Rate limiting to prevent spam
- Input sanitization

## Architecture

The application follows a modern architecture pattern with:

1. **Component-based UI**: Modular React components for maintainability
2. **Server Components**: Utilizing Next.js 13+ server components for improved performance
3. **API Routes**: Next.js API routes for server-side operations
4. **Real-time Database**: Supabase for real-time data synchronization
5. **Edge Functions**: For global low-latency operations

## Database Schema

\`\`\`sql
-- Users Table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  last_seen TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Channels Table
CREATE TABLE channels (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Messages Table
CREATE TABLE messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  channel_id UUID REFERENCES channels(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
