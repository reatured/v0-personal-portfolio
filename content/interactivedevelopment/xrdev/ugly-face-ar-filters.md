# Ugly Face AR Filters

## Overview 
In response to Lens List AR challenges for the month, I created these snap-chat filters with my existing IP: Ugly Face Generated by my p5js program.  

## Development 
I customized VFX, Shader, and script to work together on these filters. The implementation required careful integration of visual effects with Snapchat's AR platform.  

## Results 
The filters in total achieved 450k plays on Snapchat in 10 days, demonstrating significant user engagement and interest in the unique visual style.  

## Technical Details 
The filters utilize custom scripting to manipulate facial features in real-time, using Lens Studio's JavaScript API to detect facial expressions and apply visual effects accordingly.
